# Establishing-DEFND-seq-to-study-Tumor-Evolution-in-DEN-induced-Liver-Tumors
 This Repository contains the code written for the project Establishing DEFND-seq to study Tumor Evolution in DEN induced Liver Tumors

 The following code is available:
| file name | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| LAND_cleanup | Bash file that contains the basic processing of the LAND sequencing data. LAND_peak, LAND_IGV_proc, align_single and align_all are supporting bash files. |
| LAND_analysis_4 | R file that contains the Analysis of the LAND sequencing data |
| IGV plot | R file that contaijs the code to create Gviz plots. |
| DEFND-seq_analysis_RNA | R file that contains the Analysis of the obtained RNA data of the DEFND-seq sequencing data |
| DEFND-seq_analysis_DNA | R file that contains the Analysis of the obtained DNA data of the DEFND-seq sequencing data |
| DEFND_cleanup | Bash file that contains the clean up and basic processing of the obtained DEFND-seq sequencing data. Scripts count_39, count_42, count_45, count_48, DNA_count_39 and DNA_count_AS-1617760-LR-80746 are supporting bash files. |
